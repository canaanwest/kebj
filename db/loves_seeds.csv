1,art,"You are never afraid to make beautiful things--or ugly things that are meaningful. Remember that time last year when we made macabre new years cards? Wasn't that awesome? You inspire me to make art and love art and see it as a way to connect"
2,walking,"I love how much you love to walk. I remember this once in New Orleans we went for a walk together, which I would have never done by myself there at the time cuz god it was HOT AS fresh meatballs, but we walked for such a long time around city park. We'd go walk around and then sit under the chime tree and look at the water. A+"
3,sisters,"If ever I had a sister, I'm pretty sure she'd be you"
4,family,"As in: you're a part of mine, and I'm a part of yours. I love Sunday dinners debates and philosophical rants. I loved living with your fam for the month when we moved to Seattle, and I loved that you hung out with mine in NOLA <3"
